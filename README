DESCRIPTION
-----------
WWW::BBSWatch - Send via email messages posted to a WWW bulletin board

This module allows you to monitor a World Wide Web Bulletin Board and email
new postings to you. The email headers are as correct as possible,
including reasonable I<From>, I<Subject>, I<Date>, I<Message-Id> and
I<References> entries.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
LWP::UserAgent
MIME::Lite

INSTALLATION
------------
This is a simple module. The typical installation routine should work fine.

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test
  make install

PROBLEMS
--------
If the test fails, the most likely reason is that you access the internet
thru a firewall. Set the environment variable 'http_proxy' to your
firewall. For example for sh/ksh/bash
  export http_proxy=http://httpproxy:411
or in csh
  setenv http_proxy http://httpproxy:411
